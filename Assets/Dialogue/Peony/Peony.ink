As you step into the enchanting clearing with the sparkling pond, right at the heart of the forest, the air becomes thick with the sweet scent of the blooming flowers.
The soft sunlight filters through the green canopy, creating a mesmerizing and beautiful play of shadows and light on the forest floor and glittery pond.
Pastel cushions are scattered under the trees, creating a serene atmosphere for the flowerkin to relax and take time for themselves around the pond. 
As you gaze around for a vacant spot, a confident and alluring figure catches your eye. 
A flowerkin with the petals of the color of the sunset, reminiscent of a peony, sits gracefully on the pastel cushions nearest to the pond. 
As you approach she looks up and a playful smile dances on her lips.
