As you arrive at the flowery and vibrant park with cozy benches scattered around the small pond, the sound of a bouncing ball catches your attention.
The sun is shining brightly overhead, casting a warm glow on the lush greenery and blooming flowers.
Near the heart of the park, a makeshift basketball hoop has been set up and a cheerful tune plays from the portable speaker on the grass.
As you walk closer towards the sounds, you notice a flowerkin with contagious smile energetically tossing basketball in the hoop - effortlessly combining athleticism with a sunny and relaxing attitude.
After a couple of successful shots the sunny flowerkin, reminiscent of a sunflower, turns towards you and walks forward with easy, confident strides while giving you a dashing smile.
