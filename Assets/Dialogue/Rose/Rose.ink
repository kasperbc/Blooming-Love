The forest around you unfolds to a path through the trees as you venture deeper into the enchanting realm. 
In the deeper forest the air feels pleasantly colder as the thick canopy of trees doesn’t filter as much light and warmth through to the ground. 
The narrow path weaves through the towering trees, creating an inviting and adventurous route to explore. 

As you slowly navigate the subtle twists and turns of the forest path, you come  across a lone flowerkin, reminiscent of a rose standing confidently by the side of the road. # sprite neutral
