As you get closer to the sun-kissed beach stretching before you, the golden sand blends seamlessly with the surrounding greenery. # minigame
The rhythmic sound of waves calmly crashing against the shore provides a smoothing background, while a gentle breeze carries the sweet aroma of the blooming flowers.
The whole beach looks warm and cozy for both pollinators and flowerkin alike, to enjoy the sun and sea breeze.
Nestled under the shade of a large tree, you notice a picnic table and a blanket filled with the most delicious-looking treats.

As you get closer to the picnic you notice a lonely flowerkin there turning to look at you and give you a casual nod. Their eyes, a mix of ocean blues with purple, seem to reflect the calmness of the waves.

They gesture toward the place next to them on the picnic blanket. # speaker _

+ [Nice to meet you, Calanthe. This is a beautiful spot to have a picnic.]
+ [Cal it is then. Mind if I join you?]

- No worries, take a seat. # speaker Cal
So, what brings you here today?

+ [I just heard about this magical beach and thought I’d check it out.]
    Magical beach, huh?
    Yeah, I guess this place is something else.
+ [I actually got lost and needed a place to rest for a while.]
    Tell me about it.
    Sometimes you just have to take a moment for yourself to clear your thoughts.

- As you settle into a casual conversation with the calming waves in the background, the easygoing nature of Cal perfectly reflects the laid-back feeling of the beach. # speaker _
